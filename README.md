# Fake News Detection Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Classification Modeling



###Fake news poses a significant threat to society, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning classification models have emerged as effective tools for identifying fake news articles. This document summarizes recent advancements in this field, focusing on various algorithms, methodologies, and performance metrics.
Key Techniques in Fake News Detection:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques

Classification Algorithms

Several machine learning algorithms have been employed for fake news detection:

Na√Øve Bayes: Often used for text classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

Logistic Regression: A popular choice for binary classification tasks.

Random Forest: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

XGBoost: Known for its performance in structured data challenges, it often yields high accuracy rates.

Deep Learning Models: Techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) have shown promising results in capturing complex patterns in text data.$$
